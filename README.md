RatPack.js
==========

RatPack is a Rails-like MVC framework built on top of Sammy.js and LAB.js. RatPack lets you have the super-fast client-side javascript webapp you've come to love with Sammy, while easily separating functionality out across multiple files (thanks to LAB.js). Like Rails, RatPack values convention over configuration and seeks to keep things DRY.
